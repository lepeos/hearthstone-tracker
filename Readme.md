This project is for a basic Hearthstone deck tracker.

The tracker is designed to do two things. Firstly it will provide a repository where you
can build and view statistics on decks that you and others use. Secondly during the game
it should give you a live view of the current cards left in your deck with information regarding the probability of various card to improve your playing.

Currently the basics have been set up. This is a work in progress.
